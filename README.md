## Less Web Server Compiler

This is a tiny tiny webserver for compile a css file on demand
via a get request on the server...

__ATTENTION__ you need a less file already on server.

  curl http://localhost:10437/myLessFile

compile file on server __myLessFile.less__

It's my first project with NodeJS :)...
